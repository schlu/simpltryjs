		<h1>Simpltry Javascript Widget Documentation</h1>
		<h2>What's the point?</h2>
		<p>Well like many web developers who have been personally touched (in a good way) by the web 2.0 craze, we feel that it is important to be able to easily use implement enhanced functionality.  There was an article on <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/scripttriggers/">ALA</a> and decided that pushed us away from associating classes with functionality (it was not semantically working for a while but this confirmed it).  So it was time to go down the rabbit hole, and go the route that a lot of people end up going, custom attributes.  But this is expensive! Because you either mix the logic of attaching different widgets into a common place (scour the DOM once looking for all my attributes) or I had to do it over and over looking for different attributes.  The ladder was just too expensive and violated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> philosophy that <strike>good</strike> diligent programmers strive to fulfill.</p>
		<h2>Do I have to care about semantics?</h2>
		<p>Absolutely not!  Although if you write enough code and care about your quality you probably will in time.  But at the end of the day its all about writing great software.</p>
		<h2>Existing Widgets Demos!</h2>

    	<h2>Impress your boss</h2>
    	<p>At simpltry we know the pain of having a bunch of different js libraries in your system.  That is why we provided an easy way to make it seem like you wrote the code yourself.  All you need to do is include these three lines after the simpltry code is loaded.  And fill in whatever string you like.</p>
    	<code><pre>
var YourCompany = Simpltry;
YourCompany.Widgets.widgetAttribute = "your_company_type";
YourCompany.Widgets.optionsAttribute = "your_company_options"; 
    	</pre></code>
    	<p>Then anytime you would use "simpltry_type" you would replace it with "your_company_type".  The same applies to any time you would use the Simpltry object.  Simpltry.DatePicker becomes YourCompany.DatePicker.</p>
